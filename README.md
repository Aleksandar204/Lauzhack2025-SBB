# 2025 Lauzhack SBB challenge

An NFC tag based approach at solving the problem of paper tickets. The repository consists of a backend server that gives out tickets and does validation, a client facing frontend application for generating anonymized tickets that prevent leaks of user information (only ever storing the UUID as recognizable information) and an Android application for reading NFC tags and validating tickets.
